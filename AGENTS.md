# Instructions for AI coding agents

Use this file when adding Robin to **another** repository.

## Required workflow reference

Default (latest):

```yaml
uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
```

Pinned release (preferred for stability):

```yaml
uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@v2
```

For a direct action step: `antongulin/robin@main` or `@v2`.

## Do not use

- `@v0`, `v0`, or any `v0` release tag — workflows fail or point at stale code.
- `pull_request_target` — not supported; security risk with secrets.
- `synchronize` on `pull_request` unless the user explicitly wants review on every push.

## Required secrets (in the consumer repo)

| Secret | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Provider API key |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `LLM_MODEL` | Model id |
| `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` | Optional Cloudflare Access service-token client ID for the LLM endpoint; set together with `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` |
| `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Optional Cloudflare Access service-token client secret for the LLM endpoint; set together with `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` |

Free OpenRouter example:

- `LLM_BASE_URL`: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
- `LLM_MODEL`: `openrouter/free`

## Minimal consumer workflow

Create `.github/workflows/robin.yml`:

```yaml
name: Robin

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, ready_for_review]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    uses: antongulin/robin/.github/workflows/review.yml@main
    secrets:
      LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}
      LLM_BASE_URL: ${{ secrets.LLM_BASE_URL }}
      LLM_MODEL: ${{ secrets.LLM_MODEL }}
      CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID }}
      CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET }}
```

## Permissions

The job needs:

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

`actions/checkout` is optional for review-only workflows.

## Maintainers: project map and verification

Everything above is for adding Robin to a consumer repo. This section is for agents working
**in this repository**. It is a concise operating map, not a task log; keep run evidence in
task records outside the tracked tree.

**Layout.** `src/` is the GitHub Action (compiled into the committed `dist/index.js`).
`action.yml` is the action input/output contract; `.github/workflows/review.yml` is the
reusable workflow consumers call; `templates/robin.yml`, `scripts/install.sh`, and
`bin/robin-review.js` are the shipped installer surfaces; `docs/` and `README.md` are the
user documentation; `skills/robin/` is the companion chat skill shipped for coding agents.

| Path | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/main.ts` | Entry point: event/trigger policy, input parsing, orchestration |
| `src/llm-client.ts`, `src/llm-retry.ts`, `src/llm-provider.ts` | LLM request shape, retries, provider detection |
| `src/repo-config.ts` | `.github/robin.yml` parsing and input-vs-config resolvers |
| `src/agent-review.ts`, `src/review-tools.ts`, `src/repo-snapshot.ts` | Multi-turn agent review and its read-only tools |
| `src/prompts/`, `src/review-parser.ts` | Review prompts, JSON schema, response parsing |
| `action.yml`, `.github/workflows/review.yml` | Action inputs and reusable-workflow schema (forwarded 1:1) |
| `bin/robin-review.js`, `bin/account-review.js`, `bin/repo-selection.js` | Per-repository installer dispatch, account bootstrap, and repository selection policy |
| `docs/`, `README.md`, `llms.txt` | User-facing setup, behavior, and troubleshooting |

**Documentation ownership.** This root `AGENTS.md` is the documentation contract for the whole
repository: the source, workflow, docs, and skill surfaces above share this single ownership
boundary, so there are no child `AGENTS.md` files. Add a child `AGENTS.md` only when a subtree
grows its own stable contract that the root index no longer covers cleanly. The index follows the
structure guidance of [agent0ai/dox](https://github.com/agent0ai/dox) at pinned revision
[`765ae4ac`](https://github.com/agent0ai/dox/tree/765ae4ac02cc884eefcd41a3d0f71941721adb89)
(MIT, Copyright 2026 Agent Zero).

**Verification.** Run the existing checks before pushing:

```bash
npm ci
npm test                 # Jest + ts-jest
npm run lint             # eslint src/**/*.ts
npx --no-install tsc --noEmit
actionlint -shellcheck= -pyflakes= .github/workflows/*.yml testdata/consumer-workflows/*.yml
npm run build            # tsc + ncc; commit the regenerated dist/index.js
```

Keep action inputs, reusable-workflow `workflow_call` inputs, the `with:` forwarding in
`review.yml`, the installer template, and the docs in sync — `src/workflow.test.ts` guards
that parity. Behavior changes that touch optional request parameters should not silently
drop a user-configured control; surface the provider error instead.

The npm installer supports both per-repository setup and an account-level bulk bootstrap.
Keep `bin/account-review.js` behavior and options in sync with the account setup sections
in `README.md` and `docs/ADVANCED.md`. The bootstrap updates currently accessible
repositories only; it does not enroll repositories created later.

## Maintainers: release-notes upkeep (automatic)

Whenever a release lands (release-please auto-merges
`chore: release X.Y.Z` and publishes the GitHub release), clean up its notes as part of
the same task — do it automatically, without asking.

1. Inspect every release cut during the session: `gh release view <tag> --json body`.
2. Enrich each `feat`/`fix` entry with a one-line plain-language user impact, and credit
   external contributors (`— thanks [@login](https://github.com/login)!`).
3. Catch orphaned commits: a commit that lands on `main` between the release PR's
   snapshot and its merge appears in **no** changelog. Compare
   `git log <prev-tag>..<tag> --oneline` against the notes and add missing entries under
   the matching section.
4. Edit **only** the GitHub release (`gh release edit <tag> --notes '…'`). Never rewrite
   `CHANGELOG.md` retroactively — a changelog commit itself triggers another release.
5. Keep the generated format (version heading with compare link, `### Features` /
   `### Bug Fixes` / `### Documentation` sections). Never create tags or releases by
   hand, and never delete a published release.
